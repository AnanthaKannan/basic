# Kafka
Kafka just like a file system, kafka separate as a topics. who is sending the data, it is called as a producer. who is a receiving the data, it is called as a consumer.

* producer - push the data to kafka topic
* consumer - get the data from the topic
* broker - nodes
* topic - we will push the data to topic
